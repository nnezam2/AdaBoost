# AdaBoost
## An experiment to compare AdaBoost vs. regular decision trees 

The article [“A Short Introduction to Boosting”](http://www.yorku.ca/gisweb/eats4400/boost.pdf) by Freund and Shapire, describes Adaboost. In this exerciese, we want to implement the Adaboost algorithm using stumps as the base learner. Next, the algorithm would be tested on the [stagec dataset](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/rpart/html/stagec.html) in R. In this case, the response variable is pgstat and the predictor variables are age, eet, g2, grade, gleason, and ploidy.
